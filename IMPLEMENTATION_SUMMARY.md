### 4. Prometheus Alerting Rules
**Created `prometheus-rules.yml` with alerts for:**
- Host down detection (2-minute threshold)
- High ping latency (>100ms for 5 minutes)
- Packet loss detection (>5% over 5 minutes)
- HTTP service failures (1-minute threshold)
- High HTTP response times (>5s for 3 minutes)
- HTTP error status codes (4xx/5xx)
- Slow DNS lookups (>1s for 2 minutes)
- SSL certificate expiry warnings (30 days)
- Local infrastructure specific alerts

### 5. Recording Rules for Performance
**Created `prometheus-recording-rules.yml` with:**
- Pre-calculated success rates (5m, 1h, 24h)
- Latency percentiles and averages
- Network health scores (local vs external)
- Packet loss calculations

### 6. Enhanced Grafana Dashboard
**Created `enhanced-monitoring.json` with panels for:**
- Ping success rates
- HTTP success rates  
- Ping latency visualization
- HTTP response times
- Network reliability trends
- Current status overview
- DNS lookup performance
- HTTP content length tracking
- HTTP status code monitoring

### 7. Additional Monitoring Jobs
**Added to prometheus.yml:**
- `blackbox_ssl` - SSL certificate monitoring
- `blackbox_tcp` - TCP port monitoring for SSH and HTTP services
- `blackbox_dns` - DNS resolution monitoring

### 8. Automation and Validation
**Created utility scripts:**
- `setup-monitoring.sh` - Automated setup and validation
- `validate-config.sh` - Configuration validation

### 9. Comprehensive Documentation
**Created detailed documentation:**
- `MONITORING_RULES.md` - Rules, thresholds, and best practices
- `EXPANSION_PLAN.md` - Phased improvement roadmap
- `QUERIES_AND_EXAMPLES.md` - Prometheus query examples
- `IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS.md` - Advanced enhancement ideas
- `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER.md` - Customization questions

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Validate configuration
./validate-config.sh

# Start monitoring stack
./setup-monitoring.sh

# Manual start (alternative)
docker-compose up -d
```

### Access Points
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3007 (admin/admin) - *Configurable via .env*
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9097 - *Configurable via .env*
- **Blackbox Exporter**: http://localhost:9115

### Dashboard URLs
- **Original**: http://localhost:3007/d/cdwor2stprugwd/ping
- **Enhanced**: http://localhost:3007/d/enhanced-monitoring/enhanced-network-monitoring

### Port Configuration
The monitoring stack uses non-standard ports by default to avoid conflicts:
- Grafana: 3007 (configurable via `GRAFANA_PORT` in .env)
- Prometheus: 9097 (configurable via `PROMETHEUS_PORT` in .env)

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Capabilities

### What's Being Monitored
1. **External Connectivity**: Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS
2. **Local Infrastructure**: Gateway, NAS, R630 server
3. **Web Services**: Your website and external dependencies
4. **Network Services**: DNS resolution, TCP ports
5. **Security**: SSL certificate expiry

### Metrics Collected
- **Availability**: Success/failure rates
- **Performance**: Latency, response times
- **Reliability**: Packet loss, uptime percentages  
- **Security**: Certificate expiry dates
- **Infrastructure**: Port connectivity, service health

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the setup**: Run `./setup-monitoring.sh`
2. **Review dashboards**: Check both original and enhanced dashboards
3. **Validate targets**: Ensure all targets are reachable from your network
