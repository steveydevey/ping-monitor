# Network Monitoring Expansion Plan

## Phase 1: Enhanced Basic Monitoring âœ… COMPLETED

### Implemented Features
- [x] Added new ping targets: 192.168.254.254, 192.168.254.9, nas.lan, r630.lan
- [x] Added HTTP monitoring for https://home.jomby.xyz
- [x] Created comprehensive blackbox exporter configuration
- [x] Updated docker-compose with proper volume mounts
- [x] Created enhanced Grafana dashboard
- [x] Implemented Prometheus alerting rules

## Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring (RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS)

### Certificate Monitoring
- [ ] Add SSL certificate expiry monitoring for HTTPS endpoints
- [ ] Create dashboard panels for certificate status
- [ ] Set up alerts for certificates expiring within 30/7 days

### TCP Port Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor specific TCP ports on local servers
  - SSH (22) on r630.lan
  - HTTP (80/443) on nas.lan
  - Custom application ports
- [ ] Add port connectivity alerts

### SNMP Monitoring (if applicable)
- [ ] Configure SNMP exporter for network devices
- [ ] Monitor router/switch statistics
- [ ] Track interface utilization and errors

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Expansion

### Database Monitoring
- [ ] Add database connectivity checks
- [ ] Monitor database response times
- [ ] Track connection pool metrics

### Application-Level Monitoring
- [ ] Add custom application health checks
- [ ] Monitor API endpoints
- [ ] Track business metrics

### Multi-Location Monitoring
- [ ] Set up monitoring from multiple geographic locations
- [ ] Compare latency from different vantage points
- [ ] Detect regional connectivity issues

## Phase 4: Advanced Analytics

### Synthetic Transactions
- [ ] Implement end-to-end user journey monitoring
- [ ] Create complex multi-step health checks
- [ ] Monitor critical business workflows

### Performance Baselines
- [ ] Establish performance baselines for all targets
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection
- [ ] Create predictive alerting

## Immediate Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Test New Configuration**: Restart services and verify all targets are being monitored
2. **Validate Alerts**: Trigger test alerts to ensure notification delivery
3. **Dashboard Review**: Verify new dashboard displays all metrics correctly

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for common network issues
2. **Backup Strategy**: Implement configuration backup procedures
3. **Security Review**: Audit monitoring setup for security best practices

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize query performance and resource usage
2. **Integration**: Consider integrating with existing monitoring tools
3. **Automation**: Automate target discovery and configuration updates

## Success Metrics

### Monitoring Coverage
- [ ] 100% of critical infrastructure monitored
- [ ] All external dependencies tracked
- [ ] Local network components covered

### Alert Effectiveness
- [ ] <5% false positive rate
- [ ] Mean time to detection <2 minutes
- [ ] All critical issues generate alerts

### Dashboard Usability
- [ ] Single-pane-of-glass view of network health
- [ ] Clear visualization of trends and patterns
- [ ] Easy identification of problem areas

## Future Considerations

### Technology Upgrades
- Consider migrating to Prometheus Operator for Kubernetes deployments
- Evaluate Grafana Cloud for managed dashboards
- Explore OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

### Scalability Planning
- Plan for metric storage growth
- Consider metric federation for multiple Prometheus instances
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Integration Opportunities
- Integrate with existing ticketing systems
- Connect to configuration management databases (CMDB)
- Link with network management tools
